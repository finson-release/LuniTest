# LuniTest
Standalone tests (Arduino-only, no Firmata, no client) tests/demos of the Luni device driver library.

The Luni library is a tool for writing device drivers that run on an Arduino.  It is possible to use the device drivers standalone, 
or with a remote client via Firmata.  This LuniTest repo contains a small number of standalone Arduino programs that serve
as tests and as demos.
